                        <p>
                            When four classmates from a small Massachusetts college move to New York to make their way, they're broke, adrift, and buoyed 
                only by their friendship and ambition. There is kind, handsome Willem, an aspiring actor; JB, a quick-witted, sometimes cruel Brooklyn-born painter 
                seeking entry to the art world; Malcolm, a frustrated architect at a prominent firm; and withdrawn, brilliant, enigmatic Jude, who serves as their 
                center of gravity.

                Over the decades, their relationships deepen and darken, tinged by addiction, success, and pride. Yet their greatest challenge, each comes to realize, 
                is Jude himself, by midlife a terrifyingly talented litigator yet an increasingly broken man, his mind and body scarred by an unspeakable childhood, 
                and haunted by what he fears is a degree of trauma that he’ll not only be unable to overcome—but that will define his life forever.
