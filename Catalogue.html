            <div class="book-description">When four classmates from a small Massachusetts college move to New York to make their way, they're broke, adrift, and buoyed 
                only by their friendship and ambition. There is kind, handsome Willem, an aspiring actor; JB, a quick-witted, sometimes cruel Brooklyn-born painter 
                seeking entry to the art world; Malcolm, a frustrated architect at a prominent firm; and withdrawn, brilliant, enigmatic Jude, who serves as their 
                center of gravity.

                Over the decades, their relationships deepen and darken, tinged by addiction, success, and pride. Yet their greatest challenge, each comes to realize, 
                is Jude himself, by midlife a terrifyingly talented litigator yet an increasingly broken man, his mind and body scarred by an unspeakable childhood, 
                and haunted by what he fears is a degree of trauma that he’ll not only be unable to overcome—but that will define his life forever.</div>

            <div class="book-author">Sylvia Plath</div>
            <div class="book-description">The Bell Jar chronicles the crack-up of Esther Greenwood: brilliant, beautiful, enormously talented, and successful, 
                but slowly going under—maybe for the last time. Sylvia Plath masterfully draws the reader into Esther's breakdown with such intensity that Esther's 
                insanity becomes completely real and even rational, as probable and accessible an experience as going to the movies. Such deep penetration into the 
                dark and harrowing corners of the psyche is an extraordinary accomplishment and has made The Bell Jar a haunting American classic.</div>

            <div class="book-author">Osamu Dazai</div>
            <div class="book-description">Osamu Dazai's 1939 novella depicts a day in the life of a Tokyo schoolgirl. Propelling Dazai into the literary elite of
                 post-war Japan, Schoolgirl gained notoriety for its ironic and inventive use of language. Now it illuminates the prevalent social structures of
                  a lost time, as well as the struggle of the individual against "them" -- a theme that occupied Dazai's life both personally and professionally. 
                  This new translation preserves the playful language of the original and offers the reader a new window into the mind of one of the greatest Japanese 
                  authors of the 20th century.</div>
